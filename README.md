# Regex Tutorial for Phone Numbers

## Description:

The purpose of this exercise is to create a tutorial that explains a regex function, so that the user can understand the search pattern the regex defines.

The tutorial will explore a common regex pattern for matching phone numbers, explaining its various components such as anchors, quantifiers, character classes, flags, grouping and capturing, bracket expressions, greedy and lazy match, boundaries, back-references, look-ahead, and look-behind.
